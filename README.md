# Retoran's Lazyvim config

My own custom config for neovim.

# TODO

- [ ] Add DAP support <https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap>
- [ ] Experiment with [linters](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint)
- [ ] Test out [DAP-UI](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui)
- [ ] Give all keybindings names, reorganise. Maybe generate keybinding reference file from which-key
- [ ] Add proper descriptions to all keybindings using which-key
- [ ] Don't automatically install tools that are already on PATH, and uninstall tools that are on path.
- [ ] Experiment with [ast-grep](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep)
- [ ] Find convenient way to place selected word/portion of text in brackets.
