# Retoran's Lazyvim config

My own custom config for neovim.

# TODO

- [ ] Add DAP support
- [ ] Experiment with linters
- [ ] Test out DAP-UI
- [ ] Give all keybindings names, reorganise. Maybe generate keybinding reference file from which-key
- [ ] Add proper descriptions to all keybindings using which-key
- [ ] Don't automatically install tools that are already on PATH, and uninstall tools that are on path.
